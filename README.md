An explanation of how to build a neural network from scratch. Includes a tiny library for defining multivariable differentiable functions that implements backpropagation over a Directed-Acyclic-Graph and a small neural networks library on top of it based to PyTorch. This is enough to build up an entire deep neural net doing binary classification. An explanation of the modules and how to build all the way up to a binary classifier can be found in ```neural_networks.ipynb```

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/seankwarren/neural_network.git
